## Algorithms on Graphs Programming Assignment 01: Decomposition of Graphs
### Problems
Practice implementing the basic building blocks of graph algorithms: computing the number of connected components, checking whether there is a path between the given two vertices, checking whether there is a cycle, etc:
* [`/src/reachability/Reachability.java`](src/reachability/Reachability.java): Problem 1, Finding an Exit from a Maze, checks whether there is a path from a given cell to a given exit from a maze where an exit is also a cell that lies on the border of the maze (PASSED);
* [`/src/connected_components/ConnectedComponents.java`](src/connected_components/ConnectedComponents.java): Problem 2, Adding Exits to a Maze, finds connected components of the corresponding undirected graph and ensures that each component contains an exit cell.
